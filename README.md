# 🕯️ Wax

### On-device memory for iOS & macOS AI agents.
No server. No cloud. One file.

<br/>

</div>

---

Most iOS AI apps lose their memory the moment the user closes them. Wax fixes that — giving your agents persistent, searchable, private memory that lives entirely on-device in a single portable file.

```swift
let memory = try WaxMemory(url: .documentsDirectory.appending(path: "agent.wax"))

// Store a memory
try await memory.store("User prefers concise answers and hates bullet points.")

// Retrieve the most relevant context — semantically
let context = try await memory.search("communication preferences", limit: 5)
```

---

## Why Wax

Building AI agents on Apple platforms means juggling Core Data for persistence, FAISS or Annoy for vector search, and a tokenizer for context budgets — none of which talk to each other. Or you spin up Chroma or Pinecone and suddenly your app has a server dependency, network calls, and a privacy story you can't tell users.

Wax packages all of it into one self-contained file:

| Capability | Without Wax | With Wax |
|---|---|---|
| Document storage | Core Data / SQLite | ✅ Built-in |
| Semantic search | External FAISS / Annoy | ✅ Built-in (HNSW) |
| Full-text search | Another index | ✅ Built-in (BM25) |
| Token budgeting | Manual | ✅ Automatic |
| Crash safety | You figure it out | ✅ WAL + dual headers |
| Server required | Often | ✅ Never |

---

## Features

- **Hybrid retrieval** — BM25 keyword search fused with HNSW vector similarity. Gets the right memory, even when wording differs.
- **On-device embeddings** — Powered by MiniLM, running locally. No API calls, no latency, no cost.
- **Metal acceleration** — Embedding and search use Apple Silicon GPU when available.
- **Token budgets** — Set a hard limit. Wax automatically trims and compresses context to fit, every time.
- **Tiered surrogates** — Store full text, a gist, or a micro-summary. Trade recall for speed at query time.
- **Single portable file** — The whole memory store is one `.wax` file. Back it up, sync it, move it.
- **Crash-safe by design** — Append-only format with write-ahead logging and dual headers. No corruption on unexpected exits.
- **Swift 6 concurrency** — Fully `async/await` native with `Sendable` conformances throughout.

## Installation

**Swift Package Manager**

```swift
// Package.swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/christopherkarani/Wax.git", from: ".1.7")
]
```

Or in Xcode: **File → Add Package Dependencies** → paste the repo URL.

---

## Quick Start

```swift
import Wax

// 1. Open (or create) a memory store
let memory = try WaxMemory(
    url: .documentsDirectory.appending(path: "myagent.wax"),
    tokenBudget: 4096
)

// 2. Store memories
try await memory.store("The user's name is Alex and they live in Toronto.")
try await memory.store("Alex dislikes formal language. Keep responses casual.")
try await memory.store("Alex is building a habit tracker in SwiftUI.")

// 3. Retrieve relevant context for a prompt
let relevant = try await memory.search("how should I address the user?", limit: 3)

// 4. Build your system prompt with budget-aware context
let context = memory.buildContext(from: relevant) // trims to fit tokenBudget
```

### With Apple Foundation Models (iOS 26+)

```swift
import Wax
import FoundationModels

let memory = try WaxMemory(url: agentMemoryURL, tokenBudget: 4096)
let model = SystemLanguageModel.default

// Retrieve relevant memories and inject into session
let memories = try await memory.search(userMessage, limit: 5)
let systemPrompt = memory.buildContext(from: memories)

let session = LanguageModelSession(
    model: model,
    instructions: systemPrompt
)
let response = try await session.respond(to: userMessage)

// Store the exchange for future recall
try await memory.store(userMessage)
try await memory.store(response.content)
```

---

## Use Cases

- **Conversational agents** that remember preferences, history, and facts across sessions
- **Note-taking apps** with semantic search ("find everything I wrote about WWDC")
- **Photo & video apps** that index captions and transcripts for natural-language lookup
- **Personal assistants** that learn user habits without sending data off-device
- **RAG pipelines** built entirely on-device for sensitive or offline-first applications

---

## Requirements

| | Minimum |
|---|---|
| Swift | 6.2 |
| iOS | 17.0 |
| macOS | 14.0 |
| Xcode | 16.0 |

Apple Silicon recommended for GPU-accelerated embedding. Intel Macs fall back to CPU seamlessly.

## Comparison

| | Wax | ChromaDB | Pinecone | Core Data + FAISS |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| On-device | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| No server | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Hybrid search | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Manual |
| Token budgeting | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Single file | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Swift-native API | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Partial |
| Privacy (data stays on device) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

## Roadmap

- [ ] CloudKit sync (opt-in, encrypted)
- [ ] iCloud Drive `.wax` document support
- [ ] Memory clustering and deduplication
- [ ] Quantized embedding models for smaller footprint
- [ ] Instruments template for memory profiling
